# MySQL Network Configuration Status

## üåê Current Configuration

### MySQL is listening on **ALL INTERFACES** ‚úÖ

```
TCP    0.0.0.0:3306           LISTENING    (IPv4 - All interfaces)
TCP    [::]:3306              LISTENING    (IPv6 - All interfaces)
```

### What This Means

**`0.0.0.0:3306`** - MySQL is bound to ALL network interfaces on IPv4
- ‚úÖ localhost (127.0.0.1)
- ‚úÖ Your local IP address (e.g., 192.168.x.x)
- ‚úÖ Any other network interfaces

**`[::]:3306`** - MySQL is bound to ALL network interfaces on IPv6
- ‚úÖ localhost IPv6 (::1)
- ‚úÖ Any IPv6 addresses

### Current Connections

Active connections detected:
```
::1:3306 ‚ü∑ ::1 (ESTABLISHED) - 4 connections
```
These are localhost connections (from our recent tests).

## üì° Access Options

### 1. Local Access (Current Setup)
```python
DB_SERVER=localhost  # or 127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
```

### 2. Network Access (Already Enabled!)
You can connect from other machines on your network using your computer's IP address:

```python
DB_SERVER=192.168.x.x  # Your computer's IP address
DB_PORT=3306
```

## üîç Find Your IP Address

### Windows Command:
```powershell
# Get IPv4 address
ipconfig | Select-String "IPv4"

# Or more detailed:
Get-NetIPAddress -AddressFamily IPv4 | Where-Object {$_.IPAddress -like "192.168.*"} | Select-Object IPAddress, InterfaceAlias
```

## üîí Security Considerations

Since MySQL is listening on **ALL interfaces**, it can accept connections from:
- ‚úÖ localhost (127.0.0.1) - Your computer
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Network devices (192.168.x.x) - Other computers on your network
- ‚ö†Ô∏è External IPs (if firewall allows)

### Recommended Security Settings

#### 1. Windows Firewall (Currently likely blocking external access)
Check firewall rules:
```powershell
Get-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "*MySQL*" | Select-Object DisplayName, Enabled, Direction, Action
```

#### 2. MySQL User Permissions
Currently, your root user is configured for `'root'@'localhost'` only.

To allow network connections, you'd need to create a user like:
```sql
CREATE USER 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '#Unlockme007';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
**‚ö†Ô∏è Not recommended for security reasons!**

Better approach - create specific user for network access:
```sql
CREATE USER 'remote_user'@'192.168.%' IDENTIFIED BY 'SecurePassword';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON schoolschedulingdb.* TO 'remote_user'@'192.168.%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

## üîß To Change Binding (If Needed)

### Option 1: Bind to localhost only
Edit MySQL config file (usually `my.ini` or `my.cnf`):
```ini
[mysqld]
bind-address = 127.0.0.1
```

### Option 2: Keep all interfaces (current)
```ini
[mysqld]
bind-address = 0.0.0.0
```

### Config File Locations (Windows):
- `C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\my.ini`
- `C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\my.ini`

After changing, restart MySQL service:
```powershell
Restart-Service MySQL80
```

## üìä Port Information

| Port  | Protocol | Purpose                    | Status   |
|-------|----------|----------------------------|----------|
| 3306  | TCP      | MySQL Standard Port        | LISTENING|
| 33060 | TCP      | MySQL X Protocol (NoSQL)   | LISTENING|

## ‚úÖ Summary

**Current Status**: MySQL is configured to accept connections on all network interfaces, but actual access is controlled by:
1. ‚úÖ MySQL user permissions (currently localhost only)
2. ‚úÖ Windows Firewall (likely blocking external access)
3. ‚úÖ Your network configuration

**For your use case** (`.env` with `DB_SERVER=localhost`):
- ‚úÖ Everything works perfectly
- ‚úÖ No changes needed
- ‚úÖ Ready to use

**To enable remote access in the future**:
1. Create appropriate MySQL user with network permissions
2. Configure Windows Firewall to allow port 3306
3. Update `.env` with the target IP address
